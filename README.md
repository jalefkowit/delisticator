BuzzFeed Delisticator
============

BuzzFeed Delisticator for Google Chrome is a simple Chrome extension that makes all the listicles on the BuzzFeed home page less visually prominent, so you can skip them more easily.

It's a pretty simple bit of code, but I'm sharing it on the off chance it's ever useful for others learning how to write Chrome extensions.
